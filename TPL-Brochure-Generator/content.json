      "color": "cyan",
      "challenge": "Manufacturing units produce lakhs of bolts in a single shift. Manually identifying defects or missing bolts during high‑speed conveyor belt operations is impractical and error‑prone. Quality control teams needed a real‑time, automated solution to ensure best accuracy without slowing down production.",
      "solution": "We developed an edge AI solution that integrates directly with conveyor systems, with flexibility to scale for on-premise or cloud deployment as required by industry workflows. The system leverages a custom object detection algorithm optimized for embedded hardware, enabling continuous inspection of every bolt in real time. It also supports connecting to multiple CCTV cameras for simultaneous monitoring across different production lines. The system flags missing, misplaced, or defective bolts instantly and relays alerts to operators.",

      "color": "blue",
      "challenge": "Ensuring employee safety in industrial environments is a critical responsibility. Traditional manual monitoring through supervisors or periodic checks often fails to detect violations like missing helmets or vests, especially when managing large teams across multiple sites. Companies needed a reliable, real-time, automated solution that ensures compliance without adding overhead to operations.",
      "solution": "We engineered an AI-driven multi-model system capable of detecting helmets and vests simultaneously through multiple CCTV cameras across the workplace. By combining person detection with protective gear identification, the system automatically classifies each individual as safe (helmet and vest detected) or unsafe (missing safety equipment). The deployment is designed for on-premise and cloud environments, ensuring flexibility to integrate with existing IT infrastructure and security policies.",
